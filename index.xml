      <description>I organized SnowEx 2022 hackweek in collaboration with NASA. During the hackweek, I also worked on a project of &amp;ldquo;Radar Scattering Prediction&amp;rdquo;
About the project This project aims to estimate the backscattering of radar from snowpits using parameters from SnowEx data such as density, temperature, grain size and height. We are also trying to understand the relationship between these input parameters and the backscatter and evaluate the parameter sensitivity. And want to explore the link between SnowEx pit measurements and input parameters of DMRT-Bic.</description>

      <description>About the project Human communication works by turning thought into motion. However, sometimes it would be really handy if we could communicate directly from our brain. Studies on brain imaging show that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of words and so we have attempted to &amp;ldquo;Mind Read&amp;rdquo; by applying machine learning algorithms on data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reports to predict the category of words that a person may be thinking of.</description>

      <description>About the projects The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. They teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
Why did I work on these projects? The projects allowed me to visualize the results of the techniques they implement.</description>
