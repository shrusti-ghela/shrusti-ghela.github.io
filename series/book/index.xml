      <description>Why this book was written? Dimensionality reduction is a mainstay of modern data analysis - a black box that is widely used but sometimes poorly understood. I, along with my co-authors, Dr. Tripathy and Anveshritha aim to dispel the magic behind this blackbox. This book focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why Unsupervised learning algorithms work for Dimensionality reduction. We attempted to crystallize this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind all the algorithms.</description>
