<p>Human communication works by turning thought into motion. However, sometimes it would be really handy if we could communicate directly from our brain. Studies on brain imaging show that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of words and so we have attempted to &ldquo;Mind Read&rdquo; by applying machine learning algorithms on data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reports to predict the category of words that a person may be thinking of.</p>
<h3 id="why-did-we-work-on-this-project">Why did we work on this project?</h3>
<p>The brain has been a mystery for generations. The authors of the project have  always been curious to understand how the human brain works, how it perceives  images and other senses and how it functions so wonderfully. Now finally, we are  in an age where we can understand the underlying functioning of the neural structures  within the brain and make an attempt to piece together why humans respond to  situations the way they do. I and my project partner, Anuhya are from a Computer Science Background  and the science of the brain has awed us. This project gives us an opportunity  to combine our area of study (Artificial Intelligence) to our area of interest  (Neuroscience) and this is our main motivation behind taking up this project.</p>
